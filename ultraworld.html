        <h2>Announcing ULTRAWORLD Exhibition 001: Blockchain Origins</h2>
        <p>
          ULTRAWORLD Exhibition 001 is the inaugural showcase event of the
          UltraDAO Foundation World. This exhibition is set to feature an
          eclectic array of cryptoart from top international artists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slated for November 2023, this exhibition seeks to cast a spotlight on
          a kaleidoscope of artistic styles, origins, and backgrounds. We're on
          a quest for avant-garde art pieces that embody unique narratives and
          enigmatic expressions. It’s not merely about displaying art; it’s
          about sharing the riveting stories and the profound ideologies that
          birthed them. This is a call to all visionary artists to come forth
          and share their oeuvre with the world.
        </p>
        <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
        <p>
          Artists are invited to submit
          <span
            class="underline decoration-gray-100 decoration-solid underline-offset-2"
            >one artwork</span
          >
          with a detailed description and/or background on the piece.
          Submissions should be in a digital format and must not have been
          minted or sold previously. Pricing is up to you, however, we will be
          happy to make our own recommendation as well.
        </p>
        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <p>
          We will email all selected artists no later than two weeks after the
          submission deadline. At this point, we will ask you to mint your piece
          to Foundation ahead of the exhibition.
