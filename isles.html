      The extraordinary often lies just beneath the façade of the mundane. Images seen as serendipitously arranged arrays of pixels can be reorganized in thoughtful ways to reveal curious, mystical identities ripe for pareidolic conception.

        <h2>About the collection</h2>

        <p>Isles upon Deemed Rivers &amp; Other Wonders is an algorithimic 500-piece artist-curated collection that explores pareidolic concepts in each rendered image. The relationship between the final rendered image and the input image is that they both contain the same pixels rearranged to form new and often mysterious figures. The most obvious comparison is that of a reflection on a serene body of water.</p>

        <p>Daim's approach to creation involves the use of stable diffusion primarily as an input to his unique algorithm most reminiscent of a pixel sorting method. However, his unique approach presents a fascinating and sometimes haunting twist to a well-established digital art style.</p>

        <p>As the genesis UltraDAO digital art collection, this is also a special opportunity for long-time member Daim to deliver the first long-form generative art project for one of the longest-running and most well-established DAOs in the world.</p>

      <h2>About the artist</h2>

      <p>As an algorist, apeirographer, and AI artist, Daïm has built an aesthetically and methodologically diverse practice rooted in the childhood foundations of his studies under the late Jenő Zaszlavik.</p>

      <p>An exhibiting artist since 2015 and a cryptoartist since 2019, his achievements include being an NFT Awards 2020 Finalist, the first post-launch Art Blocks Curated Artist, a Museum of Crypto Art Genesis Artist, and a curator and participant of the Dakar Biennale 2022 "Forging the Future" exhibition.</p>
        
      <p>Daïm is also a collector and a thinker, having most recently authored his cryptoart manifesto attempting to contour the amorphous boundaries and values of the evolving movement.</p>
