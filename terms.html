      The UltraDAO Studios website (<a target="_top" href="http://ultradao.org">ultradao.org</a>) (the <strong>“Site”</strong>) allows users the opportunity to purchase unique Ethereum blockchain-tracked, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) (<strong>“UltraDAO NFTs"</strong>) that serve as
      digital collectibles and are originally minted by ULTRADAO STUDIOS LLC (<strong>“ULTRADAO”</strong>, <strong>“we”</strong>, or <strong>“us”</strong>). These Terms of Use (<strong>“Terms”</strong>) are a legally binding agreement between you and ULTRADAO and set forth the terms
      for your use of the Site (however accessed, whether via web, mobile, or otherwise) and the limited services made available through the Site as described herein (the Site and services, collectively, the <strong>“Services”</strong>).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN SECTIONS 11 or 12 BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND ULTRADAO WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      BY USING THE SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SITE OR SERVICES.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For clarity, these Terms do not govern your use of ULTRADAO’s and its affiliates’ other websites (e.g., ultradao.org) and associated mobile applications, nor any other product or service purchased from a ULTRADAO website or application besides the UltraDAO NFTs.
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Purchasing UltraDAO NFTs.</strong></li>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Third Party Vendors.</strong> All transactions made through the Services are managed and confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain, and are processed by third-party vendors (collectively, <strong>“Third Party Vendors”</strong>), rather than by ULTRADAO. For example,
      in order to initiate the minting and purchase of an UltraDAO NFT, and to display, store, trade and sell your UltraDAO NFT, you may need to set up, respectively, an electronic wallet with Metamask (provided by ConsenSys Software Inc.) and an account with the OpenSea
      marketplace (Ozone Networks, Inc.). By using the Services to do any of the foregoing, you agree to the terms of service, and, where applicable, the privacy policies of such Third Party Vendors, including without limitation the Metamask <a target="_top" href="https://consensys.net/terms-of-use/">terms of service</a> and <a target="_top" href="https://consensys.net/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a>,
      and the OpenSea <a target="_top" href="https://opensea.io/tos">terms of service</a> and <a target="_top" href="https://opensea.io/privacy">privacy policy</a>. Except as expressly set forth herein, those Third Party Vendor terms govern the transaction that is effectuated on the Ethereum blockchain when you request ULTRADAO to mint any UltraDAO NFT, including any related decentralized
      technologies (e.g., Ethereum), websites, services, tools, applications, smart contracts, and APIs which are provided by such Third Party Vendors.  For clarity, the Services do not include services provided by Third Party Vendors.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You hereby expressly grant ULTRADAO the right, power, and authority to transmit your information to such Third Party Vendors as reasonably necessary for ULTRADAO to provide the Services to you. ULTRADAO has no affiliation with any Third Party Vendors, and ULTRADAO does not and will not collect
      or receive any of the information, including any personal information, that you provide to such Third Party Vendors, except for any information that may be publicly available on the Ethereum blockchain. Because ULTRADAO has no control over Third Party Vendors, or their websites or
      mobile applications, you acknowledge and agree ULTRADAO is not responsible for the availability of such external websites, mobile applications or resources accessible from those Third Party Vendors, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising,
      products, services, or other materials available from such websites or mobile applications, nor does ULTRADAO endorse any such websites, mobile applications or resources, or the products or services assessable on such websites or mobile applications.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Purchase Terms.</strong> You may initiate a purchase of UltraDAO Studios NFT(s) by selecting “Mint” on the Site. As this is a blind drop, each buyer will receive a random UltraDAO NFT from the collection that will be revealed upon the end of the minting period.
      For a more complete description of this sale, please see the <a target="_top" href="/creator-membership">UltraDAO Creator Membership</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All purchases effectuated through the Site are final and non-refundable, except as set forth in the prior section. Purchases may be made by using one or more cryptocurrencies that we may elect to accept from time to time. We retain the right in our discretion to limit the
      dollar (or equivalent in other currencies) amount and number of any transactions on the Site. ULTRADAO is under no obligation to accept cryptocurrencies and we retain the right in our sole discretion to determine what currencies or payment option to accept at any time.
      You acknowledge and agree that all transactions effectuated through the Site are publicly visible on the Ethereum blockchain when made.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for all payments, fees and costs when engaging in any transactions involving UltraDAO NFTs, including, without limitation, the purchase price, transaction fees (e.g., “gas” fees) and all other fees associated with your use of the Services or the services of Third Party Vendors,
      including but not limited to purchasing, trading and “burning” a UltraDAO NFT. You also are solely responsible for payment of all national, federal, state, local or other taxes of any jurisdiction, of whatever nature whether now in effect or imposed in the future by any national federal, state, local,
      international or any other governmental authority or taxing jurisdiction, including, without limitation, any income, sales, use, value-added (VAT), goods and services and other taxes and duties associated with your use of the Services, the services of Third Party Vendors, and your purchase of UltraDAO NFTs
      from any party. You are solely responsible for any tax reporting for transactions in which you may be a seller of UltraDAO NFTs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Secondary Sales.</strong> You may have the limited right to sell or transfer your UltraDAO NFTs on the OpenSea marketplace. We do not monitor or control any marketplace purchases or sales, or any other activity beyond that on the Site.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Limited License.</strong> In connection with your purchase of one or more UltraDAO NFT, and subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, ULTRADAO may grant you a limited license to display the original artwork that was minted as a UltraDAO NFT and is associated
      with the UltraDAO NFT(s) that you purchase (“<strong>Artwork</strong>”).

ULTRADAO’s aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the net revenues actually received by ULTRADAO in connection with any transaction

    <li><strong>Arbitration / Dispute Resolution For U.S. Residents.</strong></li>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without application of conflict of laws rules, except that these Arbitration provisions shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Resolution of Any Dispute.</strong> In the event a dispute arises between you and ULTRADAO (“<strong>Dispute</strong>”), we want to provide you with an efficient, neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute. Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by contacting us by writing to
      ULTRADAO STUDIOS LLC, 6400 Orchard Park Dr., McKinney, TX 75071, United States. If, however, the Dispute cannot be resolved by the personnel directly involved, the parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute promptly by negotiation between duly appointed executive officers or other representatives of such parties,
      with full authority to negotiate and settle the Dispute. If a Dispute has not been resolved by negotiations within 90 days as provided hereinabove, such Dispute shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor (collectively, “<strong>JAMS</strong>”), for mediation as provided hereinbelow. Any party involved in the Dispute may commence mediation
      by providing to JAMS and each other party involved in the Dispute a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the Dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS’ panel of neutrals and in scheduling the mediation proceedings.
      The parties covenant that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator
      and any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties; provided, however, that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use
      in the mediation. None of the parties may commence arbitration or a civil action with respect to the matters submitted to mediation until after the completion of the initial mediation session, or 30 business days after the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. Mediation may continue after the
      commencement of arbitration or a civil action, if the parties so desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Limitation of Legal Remedies.</strong> If there is a Dispute that remains unresolved after mediation, INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, YOU AND ULTRADAO EACH AGREE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE JAMS ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES,
      ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, WITHOUT CLASS RELIEF, EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES PERTAINING TO ULTRADAO’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND STATUTORY CLAIMS THAT PURSUANT TO LAW ARE NOT ARBITRABLE. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
      misrepresentation or any other legal theory (“Claim(s)”). The arbitrator's decision and award are final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1, et seq., and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> YOU AND ULTRADAO EACH VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE SITES OR SERVICES.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> YOU AND ULTRADAO EACH AGREE THAT CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. All arbitrations under these Terms must be conducted on an individual
      (and not a class-wide) basis, and an arbitrator will have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms specifically prohibit you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others, participating in a class,
      representative, or collective action as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, acting as a private attorney general, or joining or consolidating Claims with claims or proceedings brought by any other person ("Class Action Waiver").
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief sought ("Notice"). All Notices to ULTRADAO must be
      sent to the following address: ULTRADAO STUDIOS LLC, 6400 Orchard Park Dr, McKinney, TX 75071, United States.. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us but if no such information exists or if such information is not current,
      then we have no obligation under this Section. Upon receipt of such Notice, the receiving party will have a 60-day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully curing the Claim, providing all the relief requested in the Notice, or entering into a settlement
      to resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. After the expiration of such 60-day cure period, you or ULTRADAO may commence an arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise agreed to by you and ULTRADAO in writing, the arbitration will be governed and conducted by JAMS
      before a single arbitrator with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow substantive law in adjudicating the Dispute. This Section shall be construed as a written agreement to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). You and ULTRADAO
      agree that this Section satisfies the writing requirement of the FAA. The arbitration of any claim will be conducted in the State of New York, and for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $5,000.00, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted
      in person or by telephone. Each party will pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses. The JAMS rules are available on its website at <a target="_top" href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a>. To the extent that this dispute resolution Section conflicts with JAMS minimum standards for procedural
      fairness, the JAMS rules and/or minimum standards for arbitration procedures in that regard shall control. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or for the arbitrator’s award; and any such suit may be brought only
      in Federal District Court or, if any such court lacks jurisdiction, in any state court that has jurisdiction. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability,
      arbitrability, or enforceability of these Terms including any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the clause entitled “Class Action Waiver”.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exception to Arbitration.</strong> Only disputes or actions pertaining to ULTRADAO’s intellectual property rights, or statutory claims that pursuant to law are not arbitrable, are exempt from arbitration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Survival.</strong> This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Section is declared or found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions will remain fully enforceable, except that if the Class Action Waiver for any Claim cannot be enforced, then the provision to arbitrate will not apply.
