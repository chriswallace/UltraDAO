# UltraDAO

> A DAO for the arts, by the artists. [Join the movement](https://discord.gg/zaCX4ceK).

## Manifesto

UltraDAO is a group of artists and art collectors, working together to create a strong **community** through art and technology.

The core ethos of UltraDAO is to shape and support new ways to create and experience art.

Our desire is to bring everyone together to learn, create, evolve, and share. This is why art exists, and it is what reminds us that we are human. Our goal in the short term is to use our influence to support and promote artists who are bringing the world new perspective through their unique expression and message. These important artifacts will be preserved and recorded, stewarded and shared with the world.

### Future goals

As of June 2021, our goals are currently aligned with the following:

1. Collecting NFTs with historical and intrinsic value, especially incredible art from under-represented artists
2. Building and showcasing our collection in the metaverse 
3. Growing a community and creating a strong network of creators, artists, and collectors.
4. Releasing and selling NFTs that fund other DAO initiatives and collecting activities.
5. Projects and investments proposed by and voted through by DAO members.
6. Crypto investments and long-term growth of our member wealth.

## Our NFT Collection

You can browse <a href="https://rainbow.me/ultradao.eth">the UltraDAO collection</a> to see all the NFTs we have collected to date.

### Joining the DAO

All new members of UltraDAO will be required to submit a tribute to gain shares initially. A tribute is an initial investment of capital in exchange for partial ownership of the DAO. All tributes must be submitted in `WMATIC`.

Each share in the initial fundraising period is valued at **35 WMATIC**. You may purchase **up to 500 shares**. This limit is to prevent any hostile takeover while we are establishing our early membership. The more shares you purchase, the greater your ownership and voting power in UltraDAO.

### Instructions

Joining the DAO requires submitting a member proposal and a Tribute in exchange for shares. Because we are using the `MATIC` RPC Network to manage the DAO, there are a few steps you must take before you can access the DAO platform to submit proposals and vote.

**Step 1:** Add the `MATIC` RPC Network to Metamask. You need to switch your RPC network every time you interact with the DAO. [Setup Instructions](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-matic/)

**Step 2:** Purchase enough `MATIC` in your Metamask wallet to cover your tribute amount as well as some small amount for processing proposals (gas fees). Gas is minimal so you don't need a ton, but there are some transaction fees in the next step you need to be aware of. 

**Step 3:** Use the [Matic Bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge) to transfer your `MATIC` from the Ethereum mainnet to the Matic mainnet.

**Step 4:** Wrap your tribute amount of `MATIC` using [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?inputCurrency=MATIC&outputCurrency=WMATIC). Make sure you do not wrap all of your `MATIC` as that is what you will use for gas fees on this chain (similar to ether on ethereum).

**Step 5:** Submit a [Member Proposal](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x89/0x5c0f7e6225640a82585fc2c2d92ecafc342e185a/proposals/new/member) to join the DAO. Enter your name and provide a link to your twitter or website so we can learn more about you. No need to add a description unless you want to. Enter the number of shares you would like in the DAO and attach 35 WMATIC per share in the Tribute Amount. You may also need to approve MATIC as a transaction.

###  Troubleshooting
