        <h2>About the collection</h2>

        <p>
          Fusing the unpredictability of complex mathematical equations with the
          intentionality of artistic expression, Interplay challenges the viewer
          to find order within the apparent disorder. This captivating visual
          journey aims to evoke a sense of unity between seemingly opposing
          forces, ultimately inviting the observer to reflect on the delicate
          equilibrium that governs both art and life itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project is a glimpse into the future of human/AI collaboration.
          Acting in a role akin to an art director, the artist worked directly
          with ChatGPT (GPT-4) to create the JavaScript code and WebGL shaders
          used in Interplay.
        </p>

          All the shapes and lines drawn on canvas are solid. All outlines are
          created using dots of various sizes, mimicking the effect of a pen
          stroke. The color palettes are inspired by artists who came before,
          including Tyler Hobbs, Studio Yorktown, Emily Xie, Grant Yun,
          Omentejovum, among others.
