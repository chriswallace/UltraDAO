        <h2>About the collection</h2>

        <p>
          "Interplay is a generative art project that explores the concept of
          controlled chaos and balance through the harmonious interplay of
          algorithmically generated shapes, colors, and patterns. By fusing the
          unpredictability of complex mathematical equations with the
          intentionality of artistic expression, Interplay challenges the viewer
          to find order within the apparent disorder. This captivating visual
          journey aims to evoke a sense of unity between seemingly opposing
          forces, ultimately inviting the observer to reflect on the delicate
          equilibrium that governs both art and life itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project is a glimpse into the future of human/AI collaboration.
          Acting in a role akin to an art director, Wallace worked directly with
          ChatGPT (GPT-4) to code the JavaScript and WebGL shaders used in
          Interplay.
        </p>

        <p>
          Interplay also utilizes fxparams, a feature of fxhash that allows
          collectors to participate in curating and minting their own outputs.
          Within the metadata, minters will receive credit as a parametric
          artist and receive future royalties.
